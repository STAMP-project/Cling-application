* Starting Client-0
* Connecting to master process on port 19142
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - sources/time-14/build/classes
  - defects4j/framework/projects/Time/lib/joda-convert-1.2.jar
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.base.AbstractPeriod
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Total number of test goals for DYNAMOSA: 30
* Using seed 1566085182252
* Starting evolution
* Initialsss Number of Goals in DynMOSA = 20 / 30
