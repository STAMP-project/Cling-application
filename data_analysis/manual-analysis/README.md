`stacktraces.md` lists the captured exceptions, which are only captured by test suites generated by Cling. We performed a manual analysis for each of these stack traces to indicate if any of them are **bug revealing**. The ones that we recognize as bug revealing are stored and described in `failure explanation.md`.
